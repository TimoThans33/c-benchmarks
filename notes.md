# Some notes on RISC-V and Operating System Functions

**Instruction Pointer**: I guess not a lot of RISC-V systems use instruction pointers? How else are they stored I guess in the PCB?

**Program Counter**: No direct way to get the program counter? 

**Frame Pointer**: looks like this is were the stack pointer is stored...
